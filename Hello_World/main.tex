\chapter{Hello World}



Before one begins to program, one must decide where they will write their code.
In the early days of computer science, it was common to use punch cards that would be fed into computers.
While we no longer require the use of such machines, we still need some method to not only run a program, but we also need some method to write a program effectively.
Before we begin our journey, one must prepare with the proper equipment.
This will consist of us obtaining a Java compiler and development environment.


\section*{Downloading the Java Development Kit}
As one can reasonably assume, in order to run Java code, one must download Java.
Specifically, we must \url{https://jdk.java.net/} in order to download the Java Development Kit (JDK).
