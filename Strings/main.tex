Now that you've officially created your first program, we can now take a closer look at the code you've written.
Specifcally, the component that actually outputs the phrase, "Hello, World!".
System.out.println() is a built-in Java method which will output whatever is between the parentheses.
For our first program, we put "Hello, World" inside of this method.
Given that I said that System.out.println() will output \textit{whatever} is between the parentheses, you may naturally infer that we can place some other message inside of our print statement; you would be absolutely correct to make such an assessment.
Try replacing the world ``World'' with your name.
As an example, I'm going to replace ``World'' with my name, Alfredo, and run the program.
The code and output are shown in figure \ref{fig:hello_alfredo}.

The technical term for this is a \gls{String Literal}.
To first understand this term, we must understand the term \gls{String}.
A String is a sequence of characters.
A \gls{character} is a single unit used to represent text.
In the English language, family characters include the lowercase letters ('a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z'), the uppercase letters ('A', 'B', 'C', ..., 'Z'), punctuation marks ('!', '.', ',', '\#', '(', ')'), and even digits ('0', '1', '2', ..., '0').
Of course, these aren't all the characters that exist due to the vast variety of scripts humans use, but we'll stick with
