Now that you've officially created your first program, we can now take a closer look at the code you've written.
Specifcally, the component that actually outputs the phrase, "Hello, World!".
System.out.println() is a built-in Java method which will output whatever is between the parentheses.
For our first program, we put "Hello, World" inside of this method.
Given that I said that System.out.println() will output ``whatever'' is between the parentheses, you may naturally infer that we can place some other message inside of our print statement; you would be absolutely correct to make such an assessment.
